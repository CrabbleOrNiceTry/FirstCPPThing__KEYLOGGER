# FirstCPPThing__KEYLOGGER
Hello.
To propperly use this keylogger make sure you type very carefully.
because f off. But yeah if you are trying to get someones credit card number with this key logger it wont work as 10% of the time it wont even
register a key so lol.Also if you want it to write to a file you are gonna 
have to make it into your own directoy so it goes into your C dirve. So on line 12 input the directory you want the keys to be stored in.
And when you are done fooling with this mess of a program hit the insert button on your keyboard and it will upload all of the keys typed
when the program was open into the directory you specified on line 12.
